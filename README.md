Importing data from **DVD-MT (District/Facility Data and Monitoring Tool)** into **DHIS2** typically involves several steps, which may include preparing the data for import, defining the appropriate structure in DHIS2 (e.g., Data Elements, Programs), and using DHIS2's import mechanisms such as **Data Import** or **API-based import**. While there is no specific out-of-the-box feature for directly importing DVD-MT data into DHIS2, the process can be achieved using general import functionalities in DHIS2 and requires some mapping between the DVD-MT data format and DHIS2's data model.
